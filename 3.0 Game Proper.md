## 3.0 Game Proper

After all players have finished setting up their respective zones and a first player has been determined as defined in Section 2, the game now begins. 

## 3.1 Game Phases

*Cosmere* TCG has 4 phases for each turn, taken sequentially and cannot be skipped.

1. Draw Phase
2. Status Phase
3. Actions Phase
4. Discard Phase

### 3.1.1 Draw Phase

When a player enters their draw phase, they should draw cards until they have a total of six (6) cards in their hand.

- If the Fate Zone contains less cards than the player needs, then the player should draw as many as they can. If the player ends their turn with zero cards in the Fate Zone, they automatically lose the game.
- If the player has six or more cards in their hand, then they cannot draw any cards during the draw phase.

### 3.1.2 Status Phase

Look for cards with Status Phase triggers. All of the triggers whose conditions are met will be triggered simultaneously, and their exact order of resolution will be determined by the player controlling the card that produced the trigger. The Active Player's triggers will always resolve first before the non-active players, which will resolve in turn order.

After all Status Phase triggers have been resolved, remove one counter of every type on all of the cards of the active player.

### 3.1.3 Action Phase

When an action is used by a player, first they must _announce_ their action, _choose_ a target (if necessary), and _reveal_ the card(s) that is the source of the action. Afterwards, any other players may _negate_ the action; if none does so, the action's effects will _resolve_, and the players may now check for any triggers.

During the action phase, the active player may use any of the following actions:

- _Reinforce_: If a Face card you control in the field has less than three (3) attached cards, you may use a _Reinforce Action_ targetting that card in order to attach your revealed Number card of the same color as the target. Attached Number cards add their value to the total value of the Face card, making it harder to destroy.  
- _Assault_: You may use an _Assault Action_ targetting a Face card you don't control in order to attach your revealed Number card of the opposite color as the target. During the discard phase, if any Face card in the field has less than or equal the total value of Number cards that has an opposite color, that Face card and all cards attached to it are destroyed. If a player does not have any face cards on their field, you may target the player's Joker card with an Assault Action.  
- _Summon_: Summoning allies does not require a target. If you have less than four (4) Face cards in the field, you may use a _Summon Action_ by revealing a Face card. Put the Face card in the field under your control.
- _Research_: Researching does not require a target. You may use a _Research Action_ by revealing an Ace Card. Search your Fate Zone for any card with the same Suit as the revealed Ace Card, show it to all players, then put it to your hand. Shuffle all cards in your Fate Zone.  
- _Negate_: Negating is a special action, since any player can use it at any time, in response to an action done by another player. You may use a _Negate Action_ targetting any card that has not yet resolved by revealing an Ace card. Put both the target card and the Ace card on their owner's discard pile: the target card's action's effects will not resolve.  

At any time during a player's Action Phase, they may pass the turn, beginning their own discard phase.

### 3.1.4 Discard Phase

Check the fields of all players, starting with the active player, then according to the turn order. If there are Face or Joker Cards whose total values are less than or equal to the total values of Number Cards of the opposite color that are attached to them, then those cards (The Face Cards, Joker Cards and the Number Cards) are all destroyed (put them in their respective owner's discard zone). 

Put all Number Cards which are attached to opposing colored Face Cards in their respective owner's discard zone. The player's turn is now done.
