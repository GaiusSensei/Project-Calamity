## 2.0 Starting A Game

A *Cosmere* Card Game can be played by at least two players, each with valid decks as defined in Section 1.

## 2.1 How to Win at a *Cosmere* Game

There is only one way to win a *Cosmere* Game: Survive. If you are the last remaining player in a game (eg. all other players have lost), then you have won.

## 2.2 How to Lose at a *Cosmere* Game

There are several ways to lose at a *Cosmere* Game:

- Any player may concede at any time, immediately losing the game.
- When a Card Effect declares that you have lost the game.
- When at least one of your Joker Cards is destroyed, then you have lost the game.
- At the end of your turn, if you have zero cards in your Fate Zone, then you have lost the game.

## 2.3 Zones

A zone is a virtual space where cards can be placed. Each player have six zones.

- The Player's Hand: This zone is where drawn cards are placed. This zone can only be seen by its owner, and has no size limitations.
- The Battlefield: Abbreviated as the 'Field', this zone is shared between all players, and are where cards are played. This zone can be seen by any player, but each player is limited to one (1) face-up joker card (and one face-down joker card), four (4) face cards and any number of number cards.
- The Player's Fate: This zone is where the deck are placed. This zone cannot be seen by any player.
- The Player's Discards: This zone is where destroyed cards are placed. This zone can be seen by any player.

## 2.4 Setting Up The Game

Before the first turn of a *Cosmere* Game begins, each player must clearly set up the zones where they can place cards. Each player then proceeds to do the following:

1. Remove the two (2) joker cards from the Deck, and place one of them face-up on the field. Put the other Joker Card face-down underneath it.
2. Remove the four (4) Jacks from the Deck, and place all of them face-up on the field.
3. Shuffle the deck, and put it in the player's Fate Zone.
4. Draw six (6) cards. You may discard up to six cards, and draw until you have six again.
5. Roll the two six-sided dice, and add or subtract any modifiers made by the cards currently on the field.

Whoever has the highest roll will play first. If the highest roll is tied, then those players must re-roll. When the first player has been determined, the turn order goes from them to the player to their right, in clockwise order.
