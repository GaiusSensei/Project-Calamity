## 1.0 What you need to play

In order to play *Cosmere* TCG, each player needs to have the following:

- 52-Card Deck of Standard Playing Cards
- One Black Joker card & One Red Joker card
- Two six-sided dice 
- Several small tokens that can be used as counters are also recommended, but not required.

You may replace any of the Standard Playing Card with a *Cosmere* Playing Card as long as they have identical Suit & Value. Ex. You can swap a King of Spades from your deck with a "Steelheart" (King of Spades, Reckoners Set 1)  or a "Nalizar" (King of Spades, Rithmatist Set 1), but not with "Elend Venture" (Jack of Spades, Mistborn-Prime Set 1) or "Vin" (King of Hearts, Mistborn-Prime Set 1). 

## 1.1 Card

Each deck that is used in *Cosmere* TCG consists of 54 Valid Playing Cards (52 Standard or *Cosmere* Cards, the Black Joker & the Red Joker Cards). A card is considered Valid if it has the following attributes:

- Value: Can have a written value of 1 to 14
- Type: Can be an Ace, a Number, a Face card or a Joker card
- Color & Suit: Can be a Black Club, a Black Spade, a Red Diamond, a Red Heart, a Black Joker or a Red Joker

Note: For the purposes of the *Cosmere* Card Game, 'Joker' is considered a suit- even though in most playing card games it is not.

A card can also have any of the following optional attributes:
- Name
- Flavor
- Artwork
- Keywords: A set of characteristics that has no effects by itself but allows the card to interact with other cards.
- Passives: An effect that is always active while the card is on the field.
- Triggers: An effect that triggers when a certain condition is met.
